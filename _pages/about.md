About me
========

I am a third-year Ph.D student in [ComSee](http://www.institutpascal.uca.fr/index.php/fr/comsee) group, [ISPR](https://ispr-ip.fr/) department of [Institut Pascal](http://www.institutpascal.uca.fr/index.php/fr/), UMR 6602 - [Université Clermont Auvergne](http://www.uca.fr/)/[CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/), where I advised by Dr. Omar Ait-Aider and Prof. Helder Araújo. My research topic is about  3D SLAM with non-global acquisition cameras (e.g. Rolling Shutter cameras). 

Previously I obtained my Master's degree in Geo-information Science and Earth Observation from [Faculty ITC](https://www.itc.nl/), [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/) and Bachelor's degree in Spatial-Informatics & Digitalized Technology from [Wuhan University](http://en.whu.edu.cn/).
